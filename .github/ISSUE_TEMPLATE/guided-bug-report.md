<!-- This template is for reporting bugs in Seurat-- where the package isn't doing what its documentation says. -->
<!-- If you're stuck in your analysis but don't think it's a bug in the Seurat code, please see the community wiki: https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/discussions -->
<!-- Look to the checkmarks (✅) for the information that the community needs so that this bug can be resolved. Thank you for helping to improve Seurat! -->

# Problem
<!-- ✅ Briefly describe the problem in a few sentences. -->

# Example
<!-- ✅ Give representative example code here-- the minimum code that somebody else, on another computer, would have to run to encounter the bug. -->
<!-- If you need a public dataset to help, try SeuratObject::pbmc_small or something from SeuratData: https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data -->
```r
# Write or paste the example code here
# Be sure to include imports (`library()`)
```

## Expected behavior
<!-- ✅ What should have happened when the example code was run, if not for the bug? Tell us here. It may help to link relevant Seurat documentation, which you can find at https://satijalab.org/seurat -->

## Actual behavior
<!-- ✅ What happened that proves the bug is there? This could be an error message, a plot that looks wrong, an incorrect calculation result, or something else. You can attach screenshots or files with the paperclip button. -->

# Comments
<!-- You can add any other relevant information here, or maybe your opinion of why this is happening. -->

## Other issues
<!-- ✅ Spend some time searching the Seurat issues page ( https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues?q= ) for relevant keywords, function names, and error messages. -->
<!-- If somebody has already reported this bug in another issue, please comment there instead of making a new issue, so we don't have duplicates.-->
<!-- ✅ If there are other issues that are related but not the same, please add links to them here; otherwise, just write "None". -->
